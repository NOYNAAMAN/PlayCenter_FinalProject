# **PlayCenter**
This project combines 6 projects: Pac-Man, Tetris, Calendar, Weather Forecast by Location, Tic-Tac-Toe, and Snake. Each project offers a unique and challenging experience.

## **Description**
PlayCenter is a collection of games and applications created using **C#** and **WPF** (Windows Presentation Foundation). The system displays a gallery of projects, and clicking on an image opens a window with additional information about the project or launches it.

### **Programming Language and Environment**
- **C#**: C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is widely used for developing desktop applications, web applications, and games. C# provides strong typing, garbage collection, and a rich set of libraries that make it an excellent choice for building a variety of applications.

- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**: WPF is a UI framework for building Windows desktop applications. It allows developers to create visually appealing and interactive user interfaces using XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language). WPF supports data binding, styles, and animations, making it easier to develop rich client applications.

## **System Requirements**
- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later
- WPF Desktop Application

## **Installation and Running**
1. Clone the repository using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PlayCenter.git
    ```
2. Open the solution file `PlayCenter.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Set `PlayCenter` as the startup project.
4. Build the solution and run the application.

## **Included Projects**
- **Pac-Man**: 
  A classic arcade game where players navigate through a maze, eating dots while avoiding ghosts. The objective is to clear the maze of all dots while scoring points and gaining power-ups that allow Pac-Man to eat ghosts for extra points.

- **Tetris**: 
  A well-known puzzle game where players rotate and arrange falling blocks (tetrominoes) to create complete horizontal lines. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the player earns points. The game becomes increasingly difficult as the speed of falling blocks increases.

- **Calendar**: 
  An application designed for managing and viewing events and dates. Users can add, edit, and delete events, and navigate through months and years. The calendar also displays important dates and reminders.

- **Weather Forecast**: 
  An application that provides real-time weather information based on the user's location. It displays current weather conditions, forecasts, and allows users to search for weather data in different cities.

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**: 
  A classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square with their symbol (X or O). The first player to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game.

- **Snake**: 
  A retro-style game where players control a snake that moves around the screen, consuming food to grow longer. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
